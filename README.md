# 3D Projection
This is a simple script I made to learn the fundementals of 3D rendering

It can load .obj models (albeit limited) and render it on screen, It cannot use textures or materials but it can use vertex colors.

## Preview of what it can do
The framerate isn't great in the map video but, It has been optimized quite a bit and it now runs at ~20 fps
